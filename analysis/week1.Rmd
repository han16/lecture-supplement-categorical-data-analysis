```{r, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Wald, Likelihood ratio and score inference 
Let $\beta$  be an arbitrary parameter that we want to do a significance test $H_0: \beta=\beta_0$. 

#### Wald inference 

Let $\widehat{\beta}$ be the maximum likelihood estimate (ML) of $\beta$ and SE is the standard error (which is a function of unknown parameters) of $\widehat{\beta}$, evaluated by substituting MLE for unknown parameters. 

under $H_0$,
$$ z=\frac{\widehat{\beta}-\widehat{\beta}_0}{SE} \sim N(0,1) ~~(approximately)$$
or equivalently, $z^2 \sim \chi^2_1$. The statistics that uses the standard error evaluated at MLE, is called **Wald statistics**. $z$ is called **Wald test**. 

#### Likelihood ratio test 

The test statistics is 

$$-2log(\frac{\ell_0}{\ell_1}) \sim \chi^2_1 ~~(approximately)$$
$\ell_0$ is the maximum of likelihood function under null hypothesis and $\ell_0$ is the maximum value under null and alternative hypothesis. 

It holds that $\frac{\ell_0}{\ell_1}\leq 1$ (why?) and small value of it indicates strong evidence against $H_0$ (why?). 


#### score test 

Score test calculates the standard error under null hypothesis. 

### Wald, Likelihood ratio and score inference for Binomial parameter

Use the clinical trial example that there are 9 successes in the first 10 trials, test $H_0: \pi=0.5$ vs $H_a: \pi\neq 0.5$. 

For Wald test, $\widehat{\pi}=0.9$ and SE is $\sqrt{\widehat{\pi}(1-\widehat{\pi})/n}=\sqrt{0.9\times 0.1/10}=0.095$. 
so $z=\frac{0.9-0.5}{0.095}=4.22$, p value is $p=2\times prob(Z>4.22)=2.443023e-05$. The corresponding $\chi^2$ test statistics is $4.22^2=17.8$. p value is $prob(\chi^2>17.8)$. 


For score test, under $H_0$, $\pi=0.5$, SE is $\sqrt{0.5*0.5/10}=0.158$, and $z=\frac{0.9-0.5}{0.158}=2.53$, p value is $2\times porb(Z>2.53)=0.011$. 

For likelihood ratio test, $\ell_0=\frac{10!}{9!\times 1!}\times 0.5^9 0.5^1=0.00977$ and $\ell_1=\frac{10!}{9!\times 1!}\times 0.9^9 0.1^1=0.3874$, so $-2log(\frac{\ell_0}{\ell_1})=7.36$ and p value is $prob(\chi^2>7.36)=0.007$. 


When sample size is small to moderate, the wald test is least reliable and not trustworthy. 


### Small sample Binomial inference 

When the sample size is small, it's safer to use binomial dustribution to calculate p value directly. 

In the clinical trial example that they observe $y=9$ successes in $n=10$ trials, consider the test $H_0: \pi=0.5$ vs $H_a: \pi>0.5$. p value is $p(Y\geq 9)=\sum_{y\geq 9} {10\choose y} 0.5^y0.5^{10-y}=0.011$. 

If the alternative hypothesis is two sided as $H_a: \pi\neq0.5$, p value is $p(Y\geq 9 or Y\leq 1)=2\times p(Y\geq 9)=0.021$. 

### Small sample discrete inference is conservative 

Because of the nature of discreteness of the distribution, small sample inference using ordinary p values is **conservative** in the sense that when $H_0$ is true, the $p-val<5\%$ is not **exactly** $5\%$ of the time, but typically less than $5\%$. It's usually not possible for a p-value to achieve the desired significance level *exactly* and the actual probability of type I error is less than $5\%$.  

Again consider the test $H_0:\pi=0.5$ vs $H_a:\pi\geq 0.5$ in  the clinical trial example above. 

| y | P(y) | P-value($p(Y\geq y)$) | Mid p-value |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0 | 0.001 | 1.000 | 0.9995 |
| 1 | 0.010 | 0.999 | 0.994 |
| 2 | 0.044 | 0.989 | 0.967 |
| 3 | 0.117 | 0.945 | 0.887 |
| 4 | 0.205 | 0.828 | 0.726 |
| 5 | 0.246 | 0.623 | 0.500 |
| 6 | 0.205 | 0.377 | 0.274 |
| 7 | 0.117 | 0.172 | 0.113 |
| 8 | 0.044 | 0.055 | 0.033 |
| 9 | 0.010 | 0.011 | 0.006 |
| 10 | 0.001 | 0.001 | 0.0005 |
Table: Table 1.2 Null Binomial distribution and one sided p-values for Testing $H_0:\pi=0.5$ against $H_a: \pi>0.5$ with $n=10$. 


```{r, echo=T}
counts=seq(0,10)
prob=round(dbinom(counts, 10, prob=0.5),3) # null distribution 
pvalue=round(pbinom(counts-1, size=10, prob=0.5, lower.tail = F),3)
mid.pvalue=round(prob/2+pbinom(counts, size=10, prob=0.5, lower.tail = F),4)
null_binom_dist=tibble(counts=counts, prob=prob, pvalue=pvalue, mid.pvalue=mid.pvalue)
null_binom_dist %>% print(n=11)
```

 p value is less than $5\%$, when $y=9, 10$. But the total probability is $p(Y=9)+p(Y=10)=0.010+0.001=0.011 <<0.05$. so the actual probability of type I error is much less than the desired significane level.   


If the test statistic has a continuous distribution, the p value has uniform null distribution over the interval $[0,1]$. That is when $H_0$ is true, p value is equally likely to fall anywhere within interval $[0,1]$. **The probability that p value falls below $5\%$ is exactly $5\%$ and the expected p value is 0.5**. 
However, a test statostoics having discrete distribution has the discrete null distribution of p values and expected p value is greater than 0.5. 

In the binomial example, the null expected p value is $\sum P(Y=y) \times p-value=0.59>0.5$.  

```{r, echo=T}
sum(null_binom_dist$prob*null_binom_dist$pvalue)
```

### Inference based on Mid P-value 
```{r}

```

With small sample size in discrete data, it is preferable to use **mid P-value** which adds half the probability of the observed result to the probability of the more extreme results. 

In the binomial example mentioned above, for the test $H_0: \pi=0.5$ vs $H_a:\pi>0.5$, the ordinary p value is $p(Y=9)+p(Y=10)=0.011$. For the test $H_0: \pi=0.5$ vs $H_a:\pi<0.5$, the ordinary p value is $p(Y=0)+p(Y=1)+\cdots+p(Y=9)=0.999$. Apparently, $p(Y=9)$ is counted in each p value. But if use mid p value, it becomes for $H_a:\pi>0.5$, p value is  $p(Y=9)/2+p(Y=10)=0.006$ and for $H_a:\pi<0.5$, p value is $p(Y=0)+p(Y=1)+\cdots+p(Y=9)/2=0.994$. These two mid p values sum to 1. 

For small sample size, one can construct confidence interval by using binomial distribution, not normal approximation.
