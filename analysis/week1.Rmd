## Statistical inference for discrete data 

### Wald, Likelihood ratio and score inference 
Let $\beta$  be an arbitrary parameter that we want to do a significance test $H_0: \beta=\beta_0$. 

#### Wald inference 

Let $\widehat{\beta}$ be the maximum likelihood estimate (ML) of $\beta$ and SE is the standard error (which is a function of unknown parameters) of $\widehat{\beta}$, evaluated by substituting MLE for unknown parameters. 

under $H_0$,
$$ z=\frac{\widehat{\beta}-\widehat{\beta}_0}{SE} \sim N(0,1) ~~(approximately)$$
